Developed Stable Diffusion from scratch in PyTorch, including the implementation of the Variational Autoencoder (VAE), CLIP model, and UNet architecture for generating and modifying images.
Engineered the forward and reverse processes, applying the Evidence Lower Bound (ELBO) loss function and Classifier-Free Guidance to generate high-quality data and images.
Built and integrated the Stable Diffusion pipeline, including the scheduler (DDPM) for managing diffusion steps and coding the inference code for generating outputs.
Implemented text-to-image and image-to-image functionality, incorporating inpainting techniques and optimizing the generative models to improve the quality and versatility of image generation.
